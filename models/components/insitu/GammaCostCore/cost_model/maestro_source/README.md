# What is MAESTRO?
MAESTRO is an open-source tool for modeling and evaluating the performance and energy-efficiency of different dataflows. MAESTRO is actively developed by the [Synergy Lab](https://synergy.ece.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). For more details about MAESTRO, please visit the following links.

# Codebase

## Updates
### May 26th, 2021

We updated the hardware description file, added off-chip bandwidth added as constraint.

We added a validation folder with data for Eyeriss and MAERI from MICRO 2019 paper.

### Oct 13th, 2020

We added a direct support for GEMM layers. For more information, please take a look at [here](http://maestro.ece.gatech.edu/docs/build/html/layer_supported.html).

### May 13th, 2020

We updated the naming convention of mappings and the directory structure of data folder.

### Oct 14th, 2019

Latest codebase released along with MAESTRO MICRO 2019 paper.
